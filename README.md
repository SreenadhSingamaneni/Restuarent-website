# Restuarent-website-using-Full-Stack-Technologies-

The project is developed to provide users with a website that helps in Food related navigation using Full Stack Technologies. The Restaurant home page consists of details related to the various aspects like the address, glory, and opening/closing times of the restaurant along with additional features like table registration, feedback, menu card, log in and signup. A user can log in/sign-up and go through the menu to know the cuisine, book a table in advance and give feedback to the restaurant
